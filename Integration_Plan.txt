Purpose
Check that the Campaign Scheduling system communicates and cooperates correctly with the Email Template and Recipient Management services. The focus is to catch issues where these systems interact.

Testing Focus
Template and Recipient Data Fetching: Can the scheduling system correctly pull data from both the template and recipient services?
Campaign Creation Using External Data: Can it use this fetched data to create campaigns as expected?
Error Handling: How does the scheduling system deal with failures or incorrect data from other services?
Load Handling: Is the system stable and responsive under heavy use?
Tools and Setup
Docker: To replicate production-like conditions in a controlled environment.
API Testing Tools (Postman, Swagger): For manually triggering and inspecting the interactions between services.
Automated Testing Tools (pytest): For running predefined interaction tests.
Test Steps
Template Fetching

Objective: Confirm the system retrieves all available email templates without errors.
Method: Trigger template requests via API and verify the response contains correct data.
Expected Result: The correct template list is returned.
Recipient List Fetching

Objective: Ensure the system can fetch recipient lists as expected.
Method: Make API calls to the recipient service and check for accurate recipient data.
Expected Result: Recipient lists match expected data.
Campaign Creation

Objective: Test creating a campaign using templates and recipients fetched from external services.
Method: Combine data fetched from other services in a campaign creation request.
Expected Result: The campaign is created correctly using the external data.
Error Handling

Objective: Determine if the system handles service failures gracefully.
Method: Simulate failures in template and recipient services and observe the scheduling system's response.
Expected Result: The system logs errors appropriately and does not proceed with incorrect data.
Performance Testing

Objective: Assess system performance under high load conditions.
Method: Simultaneously trigger multiple campaign setups to stress test the integration points.
Expected Result: The system maintains performance without degradation or data loss.
Test Data Needs
Lists of templates and recipients for standard operations.
Various error conditions to trigger failure modes.
Execution Strategy
Conduct tests in a sequential manner, starting from basic data fetching to more complex campaign creations.
Use automated scripts for repetitive tests and manual testing for complex scenarios.
Document all results and discrepancies in a test report for review.
Potential Issues & Mitigations
Service Downtime: Retry mechanisms and better error handling in place.
Data Mismatches: Regular synchronization meetings between teams to ensure alignment.
